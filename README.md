1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

ANS: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
REASON: Github actions automatically run all the tests on present it with the pull request. This is helpful in a project development pipeline as other people can easily check whether a developers code passes all the tests without the need for manually testing. This not only makes it easy to review but also makes the project more effiecent as testing is automated.


2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

ANS: No, you would use unit testing. You are testing the program as a whole, not a unit of the program.
